# SketchUp Ruby API Suggestions

After using the SketchUp Ruby API for some time, I've come across I few things
I'd like to see done differently, or to be added. Here's my WIP list of
suggestions.

It should be noted that none of the code is intended to be run, but rather to
be interpreted for its use. This means the signatures are by no means "final"
and any implementations may differ. The intention is for the ideas to be baked
into the API, as C code as needed

# Don't Load this!

This isn't designed to be loaded! Even though these are *.rb files, they are
only so for the convenience of syntax highlighting. The contents of these files
are suggestions, and many are not implemented (they just add methods that
throw errors). Point is, these files are for reading, not executing :P

## Have more suggestions?

If you know ruby, you can fork this repo, add it (either implement it or
create a method that raises a `NotImplementedError`) and document it then
submit a pull request.

If you don't know ruby - or just can't be bothered to do the above - open an
issue and describe the suggestion.

## Think I'm wrong?

Use the commenting features here on github. I'd love to hear from you.

## What's the point?

This is just as much organisation for me as it is getting this information
out. I've kept it somewhat organized and well described, but there's still a
lot of work to be done. Also, if I never do anything nothing will get done, so
here's me doing something.
